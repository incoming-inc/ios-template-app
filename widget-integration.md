The Sourse PVN widget uses the app extensions feature of iOS 8 and later, to play the last notified video right within the iOS Notification centre. When tapped, the widget opens your application and resume playing the PVN video. This document describes how to integrate the widget in your application. 

## Widget types ##

The Sourse PVN widget can be configured in three mode: 

* Video widget: the widget plays video straight in the Today view. The video player start muted by default, and can be unmuted by the user. 
* Static thumbnail: the widget shows the thumbnail, title and duration of the video 

## Widget designs ##

A simple adaptive widget design is included with the SDK, which appearance can be customised. 

![Widget design](./images/widget-design.png)

As of v1.8, the widget zip archive includes the interface builder source which can be customised to suit your needs, c.f. [customisation](#customisation) section below. 
 
## Pre-requisites

You will need: 

* XCode 7 or above
* Access to the apple developer portal for your app ID
* Your app project, [configured to use the Sourse Push Video Notification SDK](./). 


## Apple developer portal configuration ##

The widget is an iOS 8 app extension of the “Today View” type (c.f. [https://developer.apple.com/app­extensions/](https://developer.apple.com/app­extensions/))​.
Its code therefore reside in a separate target under your XCode project, with a separate Bundle ID (‘app id’). You need to configure two bundle ID in the apple developer portal: one for your application and one for the widget. In addition, the SDK and the widget must be part of the same apple __app group__, to be able to communicate and exchange data (c.f. the “Sharing Data with your Container app” section at [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Ext ensionScenarios.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Ext ensionScenarios.html)).


### Create the bundle IDs ###

Log in the Apple developer portal, and click __Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles__, then __Identifiers__ under __App Ids__.

![Create app ID screenshot](./images/widget_appledev_app_id.png)

Create two app IDs with the following structure:

 * `com.yourcompany.yourapp` (if not created already)
 * `com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget`

Note: The host application cannot use a wildcard app id (in the form com.yourcompany.*), as the Sourse Push Video Notification requires push notifications


### Create the app group ### 

The widget and host application use a shared filesystem area to communicate and exchange data. To enable this shared filesystem, the containing app's main target and the widget app IDs need to be part of the same "App Group".

To create the app group, still in the apple developer portal, click Identifiers / App Groups / +. Name it e.g. `group.com.yourcompany.yourapp` (Apple recommends that the group name should start with ‘group’).

### Configure app IDs to use the app security group ###

In the Apple Developer portal, select “Identifiers” / "App IDs” and enable the App Group service for both app IDs previously created, by clicking the app ID, then ‘Edit’ at the bottom, then toggle the ‘App Groups’ service, click “edit” and select the app group created in the previous step.

### Re-generate provisioning profiles ###

__Note: If you are using XCode 8 automatic provisioning feature, you may skip this section__

Provisioning profiles must be re­generated so that the app group service is enabled when building your application. In the Apple Developer Portal, go to “Provisioning Profiles”, and generate a provisioning profile __for each app ID__.

## XCode project configuration

### Create the widget target

Create a new target for the widget, using File > New > Target > Application Extension > Today Extension

![Create widget target in Xcode](./images/widget_create_target.png)

For the product name, enter e.g ‘widget’, which should automatically set the bundle ID to `com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget`. This bundle ID should match the app ID created previously in the Apple Developer Portal.

Note: You may want to have the widget's target bundle version number identical to the containing app bundle version number, or you may get a warning when submitting your app to iTunes connect.

### Configure the widget target Deployment Target

In XCode, click on the widget, the go to the "General" configuration tab. In the "Deployment Target" area, enter "8.0" (or higher if your app doesn't support 8.0) for the deployment target. 


### Configure the app and widget target capabilities

In the XCode project navigator, select your project, then your application target, and select the Capability pane. Scroll down to “App Group”, and select the app group previously created in the Apple Developer Portal. If you don’t see your app group, click the reload button (next to the ‘+’ button). Repeat this step for the widget target. Both targets must be configured with the App Group capability.

![Configure widget target capabilities](./images/widget_configure_target_capabilities.png)


### Configure the Sourse Push Notification SDK widget

This step ensures that the Sourse PVN SDK addresses the right widget. Download the [incoming-widget.plist](./incoming-widget.plist) configuration file and add it to your project, by dragging it onto your newly created widget target in XCode. Make sure to check "copy files if needed", it needs to be be added to the widget bundle.

Edit the _incoming-widget.plist_ file in your project, and add these two entries:

 * `widget_bundle_id`​ set to your widget bundle id, e.g. com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget
 * `security_application_group`​ set to your group name, e.g. group.com.yourcompany.yourapp

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_sdk_configuration_file.png)

### Configure the target provisioning profiles

This step ensure that each target embeds the right provisioning profile. In both main app and widget target’s build settings, scroll down to the “Code Signing” and check that the “Provisioning Profile” setting is set to “Automatic”. Alternatively, select the provisioning profiles previously created in the Apple Developer Portal.

### Add an application launch URL scheme

When the widget is tapped, your host application is launched and plays the video shown on the widget. This is achieved using a custom URL scheme, which needs to be registered.
Note that this URL scheme is in addition to any other URL schema that your app may already be handling. For example if your app is handling a URL scheme `myproduct://`, you may want to add a new one called `myproduct­pvn://`

In XCode, select your app main target, then to the “Info” pane, scroll to the bottom to reveal the “URL types” section. In “URL Schema” add a the URL scheme. (You may want to refer to e.g. [http://appurl.org/](http://appurl.org/)​to check for the uniquess of your app url schemes). 

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_app_url1.png)

In addition, you need to add the URL to the _incoming­-ios-­sdk.plist_ file, in your main app’s target. The key is `app_url_scheme`, and the URL scheme should be entered without the ```://```, i.e. ```pushvideotest``` and not ```pushvideotest://```

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_app_url_sdk_config.png)

### Add the Sourse widget library and assets to your Today Widget target

You can add the Sourse widget library using either cocoapod. 

#### Cocoapod method

To add the widget library to your Today Widget target, amend your Podfile using the following

        # (Replate MyAppWidget with your target name)
        target 'MyAppWidget' do
            pod 'IncomingSDK/TodayWidget'
        end
		
then run `pod install`

#### Zip Archive method

From the Sourse PVN SDK zip archive distribution, drag the TodayWidget subfolder to your project, adding them to widget target.

##### Configure the widget target Linker Flags

(This step can be skipped if using cocoapod). In XCode, click on the widget's target, then on the "Build Settings" tag. Search for 'Other Linker Flags' in the top right search box, and enter '-ObjC' for the 'Other Linker Flags' option.  

![Configure widget target linker flags in Xcode](./images/widget_other_linker_flags.png)

### Configure your Today Widget target

Set the widget target's main interface file, by clicking on your widget's target, then the 'General' tab, and the 'main interface' settings in the 'General' tab. 

![Configure widget target's main interface](./images/widget_setup_target.png)

__Note__: the widget is entirely implemented in the supplied framework and bundle. However, the target must contain at least one compilable source file so that the framework can be linked against something. 

### Edit widget configuration

Edit the _incoming-widget.plist_ file as follows:

* edit the `widget_type` key using the a number, with values 0 or 1, as follows:
  * 0 : Video widget: the widget plays video straight in the Today view. The video player start muted by default, and can be unmuted by the user.
  * 1 : Static thumbnail: the widget shows the thumbnail

* replace the `security_application_group` entry with the security group previously defined in the Apple Developer portal, e.g. `group.com.yourcompany.yourapp`
* replace the `app_url_scheme` key, and enter the url scheme defined in the ‘Add application launch URL scheme’ section above


![Edit widget configuration file](./images/widget_edit_widget_config.png)


### Testing

The widget needs to be installed manually (this a limitation of iOS), by pulling down Notification Center, scrolling to the bottom, clicking "Edit", then the "+" button next to the widget's name. 

To test that the widget is working correctly, start your application, background the application, and wait until one video push notification appears (note that notifications are not revealed when the application is in the foreground). 

 * Pull down Notification Center, you should see the widget, with the video playing back
 * The widget shows the video from the last notification.
 * When tapping the animated volume control button, the video audio should un-mute. When closing Notification Center, or scrolling past the widget, the audio should mute again. 
 * When tapping the widget, the app should start and play the same video, starting at the same timecode the user left off in the widget.
 * When hitting the close button, the widget should be hidden, only to be revealed again when the next push notification is fired 


### Customisation

As of version 1.8, the widget supplied with the Sourse PVN SDK includes allows for a limited customisation opportunity, as the Interface Builder file implementing the widget design is included in the archive. The ISDKWidget.storyboard file allows the following UI elements to be safely customised:

- Background color
- Label sizes and position, font size and color 

Note that to adapt the display to any video aspect ratio, additional constraints are applied to the view at runtime, in code. This may interfere with any change in the constraints you make. 

Please contact your Sourse representative for further customisation opportunities.
