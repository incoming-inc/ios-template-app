The Sourse PVN widget uses the app extensions features of iOS8, to display a thumbnail of last shown notification in the Today view. When tapped, the widget opens your application and plays the PVN video. This document describes how to integrate the widget in your application. Download the widget supplementary archive from the Sourse Control panel, or speak to your Sourse representative. 

__Note__:

___The This document provides an example of how to create and integrate a today widget, with source code provided alongside the ISDK. However, you are free to implement your own widget code and skip most of this document. In this case, the PVN SDK can provide access to the video meta-data, and thumbnail image to display in your widget. For this, you will want to check the ISDKWidget.h and ISDKWidgetHelper class in the widget zip archive, and go through the 'Edit the widget configuration file' and 'Edit the Sourse PVN SDK configuration file' sections of this document___.


## Widget designs ##

We provide two widget designs, large and compact which are shown below. 
![Small widget example](./images/widget_small.png)
![Large widget example](./images/widget_large.png)

All the widget code/XIBs is available for you to modify, you are therefore free to customise the look and feel.


## Pre-requisites

You will need: 

* XCode 6 or above
* Access to the apple developer portal for your app ID
* Your app project, [configured to use the Sourse Push Video Notification SDK](./). 
* the _incoming-ios-sdk-widget-*.zip_ supplementary archive, available from the Sourse Control Panel


## Apple developer portal configuration ##

The widget is an iOS 8 app extension of the “Today View” type (c.f. [https://developer.apple.com/app­extensions/](https://developer.apple.com/app­extensions/))​.
Its code therefore reside in a separate target under your XCode project, with a separate Bundle ID (‘app id’). You must therefore configure two bundle ID in the apple developer portal: one for your application and one for the widget. In addition, the SDK and the widget must be part of the same apple app group, to be able to communicate and exchange data (c.f. the “Sharing Data with your Container app” section at [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Ext ensionScenarios.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Ext ensionScenarios.html)).


### Create the bundle IDs ###

Log in the Apple developer portal, and click __Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles__, then __Identifiers__ under __App Ids__.

![Create app ID screenshot](./images/widget_appledev_app_id.png)

Create two app IDs with the following structure:

 * `com.yourcompany.yourapp` (if not created already)
 * `com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget`

Note: The host application cannot use a wildcard app id (in the form com.yourcompany.*), as the Sourse Push Video Notification requires push notifications


### Create the app group ### 

The widget and host application use a shared filesystem area to communicate and exchange data. To enable this shared filesystem, the containing app's main target and the widget app IDs need to be part of the same "App Group".

To create the app group, still in the apple developer portal, click Identifiers / App Groups / +. Name it e.g. `group.com.yourcompany.yourapp` (Apple recommends that the group name should start with ‘group’).

### Configure app IDs to use the app security group ###

In the Apple Developer portal, select “Identifiers” / "App IDs” and enable the App Group service for both app IDs previously created, by clicking the app ID, then ‘Edit’ at the bottom, then toggle the ‘App Groups’ service, click “edit” and select the app group created in the previous step.

### Re-generate provisioning profiles ###

Provisioning profiles must be re­generated so that the app group service is enabled when building your application. In the Apple Developer Portal, go to “Provisioning Profiles”,and generate a provisioning profile __for each app ID__.

## XCode project configuration

### Create the widget target

Create a new target for the widget, using File > New > Target > Application Extension > Today Extension

![Create widget target in Xcode](./images/widget_create_target.png)

For the product name, enter e.g ‘widget’, which should automatically set the bundle ID to `com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget`. This bundle ID should match the app ID created previously in the Apple Developer Portal.

Note: You may want to have the widget's target bundle version number identical to the containing app bundle version number, or you may get a warning when submitting your app to iTunes connect.

### Configure the widget target Deployment Target

In XCode, click on the widget, the go to the "General" configuration tab. In the "Deployment Target" area, enter "8.0" (or higher if your app doesn't support 8.0) for the deployment target. 

### Configure the app and widget target capabilities

In the XCode project navigator, select your project, then your application target, and select the Capability pane. Scroll down to “App Group”, and select the app group previously created in the Apple Developer Portal. If you don’t see your app group, click the reload button (next to the ‘+’ button). Repeat this step for the widget target. Both targets must be configured with the App Group capability.

### Configure the Sourse Push Notification SDK

This step ensures that the Sourse PVN SDK addresses the right widget. Edit the _incoming-­ios-­sdk.plist_ file in your project, and add these two entries:

 * `widget_bundle_id`​ set to your widget bundle id, e.g. com.yourcompany.yourapp.widget
 * `security_application_group`​ set to your group name, e.g. group.com.yourcompany.yourapp

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_sdk_configuration_file.png)

### Configure target provisioning profiles

This step ensure that each target embeds the right provisioning profile. In both main app and widget target’s build settings, scroll down to the “Code Signing” and check that the “Provisioning Profile” setting is set to “Automatic”. Alternatively, select the provisioning profiles previously created in the Apple Developer Portal.

### Add an application launch URL scheme

When the widget is tapped, your host application is launched and plays the video shown on the widget. This is achieved using a custom URL scheme, which needs to be registered.
Note that this URL scheme is in addition to any other URL schema that your app may already be handling. For example if your app is handling a URL scheme `myproduct://`, you may want to add a new one called `myproduct­pvn://`

In XCode, select your app main target, then to the “Info” pane, scroll to the bottom to reveal the “URL types” section. In “URL Schema” add a the URL scheme. (You may want to refer to e.g. [http://appurl.org/](http://appurl.org/)​to check for the uniquess of your app url schemes). 

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_app_url1.png)

In addition, you need to add the URL to the _incoming­-ios-­sdk.plist_ file, in your main app’s target. The key is `app_url_scheme`, and the URL scheme should be entered without the ```://```, i.e. ```pushvideotest``` and not ```pushvideotest://```

![Configure SDK configuration file](./images/widget_app_url_sdk_config.png)

### Add the Sourse widget code to your project

Unzip the _incoming-ios-sdk-widget-*.zip_ supplementary archive. Add all the files to your project, adding them to widget target.

Set the widget target's main interface file, by clicking on your widget's target, then the 'General' tab, and the 'main interface' settings in the 'General' tab. 

![Configure widget target's main interface](./images/widget_setup_target.png)


### Edit the widget configuration file

Open the _incoming-widget.plist_ file, and replace the `security_application_group` entry with the security group previously defined in the Apple Developer portal, e.g. `group.com.yourcompany.yourapp`. In addition, edit the `app_url_scheme` key, and enter the url scheme defined in the ‘Add application launch URL scheme’ section above.
